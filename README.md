The objective of this repository is to provide access to the trained model for use and validation in other cohorts. 

The requisite files for use are available via the following link.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AJJ1OmYYeNQmCVLgoYRhCp5ocvxrfJdk/view?usp=drive_link

The description of the variables and the format in which they should be imputed can be found in the variables.xlsx file and the test sheet, test_file.xlsx.

All files must be extracted into the working directory in order to be modified in the testing.R file. This is the default directory.
